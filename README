Contacts book
This program is used to save information about the subscriber and his number. In it, you can view contacts (1), sort contacts (2), add a contact (3), edit a contact (4), delete a contact (5), find a contact (6). You can find a contact by name, surname, phone, email and group. A feature of my program is the presence of additional functions, which I never lacked. One of them is the presence of a date of birth. Another function is related to the presence of different operators in Ukraine: "Kyivstar", "Vodafone", "Lifecell". Most of their tariffs have time limits for conversations with other operators. Therefore, I decided to identify operators by phone number so that it would be convenient for the user to calculate the conversation time. In addition, there are also checks for the existence of the number. The developed program can be improved and used as an application for mobile phones.
